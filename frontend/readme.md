## Next Steps

The following tasks are pending:

- [ ] Create `public/index.html`
- [ ] Create `src/components/CredentialList.jsx`
- [ ] Create test setup files
- [ ] Configure Hardhat for smart contracts
- [ ] Connect frontend to deployed contracts
- [ ] Add wallet integration
- [ ] Implement credential management UI

---

## Recommended Next Task

**Create `CredentialList.jsx` next.**

Reason:
1. It is a core UI component for displaying DID credentials.
2. Other pages can be built around it.
3. It helps define the data structure needed for smart contract integration.
4. The component can be tested independently before blockchain connectivity is added.

Example location:

```text
src/components/CredentialList.jsx
```

After that, configure Hardhat and connect the frontend to deployed contracts.
